This repository contains examples of common borrowing errors in Rust. The `bug.rs` file shows code that illustrates these errors. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides corrected versions of the code. This is a good resource for learning about mutable references and borrowing in Rust.  The example shows the correct usage of mutable references as well as an illustration of the error caused by double mutable borrows and immutable borrows that conflict with mutable borrows.
